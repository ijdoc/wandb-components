# PML is the poor man's launch

PML is a set of automation templates for your Weights & Biases (W&B) projects. PML has two primary use cases:
1. **When logging the frontend as an HTML panel**: you can trigger an arbitrary script, using any of the provided backend cloud function examples, directly from the W&B UI.
2. **When deploying a backend**: you can implement:
   - a custom backend handler for your logged custom frontend trigger, or
   - a serverless handler for your W&B automations (a.k.a. webhooks), or
   - both!

## Motivation

W&B used to offer a built-in, no-frills orchestration feature called 'Launch', which has since been deprecated. The templates in this repo should facilitate the integration of W&B with other best-in-class 3rd-party tools that replace, and improve on, the original Launch functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo will primarily focus on the frontend, serverless (Lambda) function and SageMaker backend implementations. All other templates will be provided for reference, as generated by ChatGPT, without any meaningful testing or maintenance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Frontend
- Install node (& npm)

#### Backends
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage python environments and dependencies
- Install [pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/)
- Configure your cloud provider or onprem infra access credentials

### Local Development

#### Frontend

- Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., `frontend/`)
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the local development server: `npm dev`

#### Backends

- Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., `backends/aws-lambda/`)
- Deploy: `pulumi up`.

### Deployment

#### Frontend

#### Backend
